### How to Use

- Select the target score from the dropdown
- Click the +1 Player One or +1 Player Two buttons to increment scores
- When a player reaches the target score and leads by at least two points, the game ends.

## Potential Upgrades 
Here are a few ways this project can be improved and extended:

- Timer: Add a countdown or stopwatch for timed matches

  Looking forward to expend my knowlegde in JS and to soon work on some upgrade of it.
